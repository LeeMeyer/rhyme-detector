Lights from the sea's surface intertwine to enmesh my body as I hover
embracing and pacing my saline gilded prison my dark lover
the sea surrounds and enters me
occludes my airway with her liquid tongue
ensnares me in a kiss that fills each lung
my limbs start flailing 
my swimming emotions trailing 
my life's timeline catches on each milestone
I tried to sideline I tried to sideline in swimming upwards alone 
buoyed up tantalisingly near 
my soul devoid of all the points of light I know will disappear  
still thrashing against fatality
distort my own reality
the waters I implore for what I need
award a diadem of seaweed
